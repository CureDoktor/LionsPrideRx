      <p>Potential Risks of Telehe alth:</p>
      <p>
        • Telehealth may feel different and may make it challenging for you to
        communicate with and provide adequate information to your healthcare
        provider, as it is outside the typical healthcare setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        • Your healthcare provider may not be able to diag nose or treat you
        because physical tests and a close physical examination may be required,
        which cannot be conducted remotely.
      </p>
      <p>
        • Missed signs and symptoms that require emergency medical treatment or
        further medical testing may occur due to the inability t o physically
        examine you, and your healthcare provider may not be able to provide
        medical treatment for your specific condition through telehealth,
        necessitating alternative care.
      </p>
      <p>
        • Technological failures may cause disruptions in your tele - visit with
        your healthcare provider or delays in your evaluation and treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        • Technological failures may cause diagnostic images or specimens to be
        distorted as a result of electronic transmission issues, unauthorized
        access to your information, or loss of informati on due to technology
        failures. If you are not in a private location during your tele - visit,
        people nearby may overhear information that you wish to keep
        confidential.
      </p>
      <p>
        • In some jurisdictions, there may be regulatory requirements,
        particularly related to c ertain prescriptions, that limit your
        healthcare provider&apos;s treatment options.
