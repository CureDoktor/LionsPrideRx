        <b>24. California Proposition 65 Warnings :</b> Under Proposition 65, a
        California law enacted in 1986, products that may expose California
        consumers to chemicals known by the state to cause cancer or
        reproductive toxicity must carry warnings. The goal of these warnin gs
        is to help California consumers make informed choices about their
        exposure to such chemicals. The California Office of Environmental
        Health Hazard Assessment administers the program and maintains a list of
        more than 850 chemicals that require warnings. New regulations were
        adopted by the OEHHA in August 2016, which became effective on August
        30, 2018, and they change the information required in the warnings. We
        have included the following warning for products associated with this
        page: WARNING: Bisphenol A (BPA): Products may contain linings with
        Bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical known by the state of California to cause
        harm to the female reproductive system. Jar lids and bottle caps may
        also contain BPA. You can be exposed to BPA when you ingest products pa
        ckaged in these containers. For more information, visit
